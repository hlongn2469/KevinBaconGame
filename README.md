# KevinBaconGame

The object of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin Bacon via shared movie roles. The minimum number of links is an actorâ€™s Bacon number. For instance, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1; he was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Sally Field has a Bacon number of 2, because she was in Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks, who was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Almost all well-known actors have a Bacon number of 1 or 2.
